# Web Development Crash Course: Building a Message Board
Over the course of several videos, we'll be building an authenticated message board from scratch with
Express, Handlebars, and SQLite. This series is aimed at people who are familiar with programming but new to web development.

This series is based on a lecture I've given several times, including at Sunhacks 2020 and in Justin Selgrad's CPI310 class.
